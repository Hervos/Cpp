This file showcases the implementation and usage of unique pointers in C++. It includes a custom implementation of unique_ptr and a derived class non0_ptr with runtime checks to ensure the pointer is non-null. Through tests and demonstrations, it illustrates the functionality of move semantics, pointer access, and resource management using unique pointers. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pointer safety and runtime validation in memory management.
