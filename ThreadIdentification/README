This file demonstrates thread identification and synchronization in C++. It defines functions to generate unique thread identifiers and print text with associated thread identifiers. The main function tests the functionality using std::async with both std::launch::async and std::launch::deferred policies, showcasing the differences in thread execution behavior. The code emphasizes the importance of thread safety and synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes for shared resources like std::cout.
