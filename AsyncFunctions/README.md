This file showcases the usage of asynchronous functions in C++ using std::async and various launch policies. It defines a function printInfo to print messages with associated thread IDs and an asyncFunction that asynchronously executes multiple tasks with different messages. The main function demonstrates the execution of asyncFunction with a combination of std::launch::async and std::launch::deferred policies, illustrating the different behaviors of synchronous and asynchronous task execution. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of thread safety when accessing shared resources like std::cout.
