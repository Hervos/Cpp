This file implements a thread pool in C++ for concurrent task execution. It utilizes a pool of threads to execute a queue of tasks asynchronously, demonstrating the principles of multithreading and task management. The thread_pool class includes methods for adding tasks, calculating the average result of completed tasks, and stopping the pool's operation. The main function illustrates the usage of the thread pool by creating tasks, calculating their results, and verifying the correctness of the average calculated by the pool.
